# Medical Department Transformation Documentation

## Overview

The hospital system has been completely transformed from a **registration-based workflow** to a **doctor-input treatment system** with AI-powered recommendations and pharmacy integration.

## Key Changes

### 1. From Registration Forms to Doctor Input

**Before:**
- Patients filled out registration forms for each department
- Doctors reviewed registration data
- Manual scheduling and assessment

**After:**
- Doctors directly input patient health problems
- AI analyzes symptoms and provides treatment recommendations
- Doctors review and harmonize AI suggestions
- Prescriptions automatically sent to pharmacy

### 2. New Workflow Process

```
Patient Assessment → AI Analysis → Doctor Review → Treatment Harmonization → Pharmacy Integration
```

#### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Patient Assessment Input**
   - Doctor selects patient from existing records
   - Enters chief complaint and presenting symptoms
   - Records vital signs and clinical findings
   - Adds lab results and diagnostic tests

2. **AI Analysis & Recommendations**
   - AI analyzes patient data against medical databases
   - Generates diagnosis suggestions with confidence scores
   - Recommends treatment plans and medications
   - Provides warnings and additional test suggestions

3. **Doctor Review & Clinical Decision**
   - Doctor reviews AI recommendations
   - Applies clinical expertise and experience
   - Approves or modifies treatment plan
   - Adds clinical notes and considerations

4. **Treatment Harmonization**
   - System combines AI recommendations with doctor input
   - Creates final treatment plan with increased confidence
   - Documents approval chain and timestamps
   - Prepares prescription data

5. **Pharmacy Integration**
   - Prescriptions automatically sent to pharmacy system
   - Tracks prescription status (pending → processing → ready → dispensed)
   - Maintains audit trail of all medications
   - Updates patient health records
