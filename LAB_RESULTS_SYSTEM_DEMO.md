## AI Analysis Examples

### Normal Result (CBC)
```
Interpretation: White blood cell count is within normal limits
Clinical Significance: Normal CBC suggests healthy blood cell production
Risk Level: Low
Accuracy: 96%
Patient Education: Your blood count is normal, indicating healthy immune function
```

### Abnormal Result (Glucose)
```
Interpretation: Glucose level is 110 mg/dL, slightly elevated
Clinical Significance: May indicate prediabetes or diabetes risk
Risk Level: Moderate
Accuracy: 94%
Recommendations: Lifestyle modifications, follow-up testing
```

### Critical Result (HbA1c)
```
Interpretation: HbA1c of 8.2% indicates poor glycemic control
Clinical Significance: Significantly increases risk of complications
Risk Level: Critical
Accuracy: 98%
Urgent Action: Immediate medication review required
```
